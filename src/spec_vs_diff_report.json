The frontend includes home page with hero section, photo gallery, news section, admission form with photo upload, and admin panel with Internet Identity authentication. The backend stores admission submissions, manages gallery photos, and handles news posts. However, there is missing email field in the admission form implementation and some design/color scheme details are not fully verifiable from the diff.",
