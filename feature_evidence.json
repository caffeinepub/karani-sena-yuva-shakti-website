      "featureTitle": "In the home page hero section (HomePage.tsx), update the 'प्रवेश के लिए आवेदन करें' (Apply for Admission) call-to-action button to use a distinct, visually contrasting highlight color that makes it stand out prominently from the other buttons and the hero background. The highlight color should complement but contrast clearly with the existing saffron/gold/deep-red theme — for example, a bright emerald green, royal blue, or vibrant accent not currently used on the page. Ensure the button retains readable text, appropriate hover/focus states, and remains visually consistent with the overall warm traditional design language.",
