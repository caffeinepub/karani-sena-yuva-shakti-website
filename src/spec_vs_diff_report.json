  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all requirements. The backend now allows anonymous admission submissions, includes fatherName field, generates unique 10-character admission IDs (YYYY0-XXXXX format), and stores all data. The frontend includes a father's name input field after full name, displays a printable admission card after submission showing all required details including the unique ID, and the admin panel displays admission IDs prominently in the submissions list. All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the diff evidence.",
