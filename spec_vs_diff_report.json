  "summary": "The diff modifies HomePage.tsx to render a circular emblem logo in the hero section using the path /assets/generated/logo-emblem.dim_512x512.png. However, the BuildRequest specifies the image should be saved and served from frontend/public/assets/generated/logo-emblem.png (not the .dim_512x512.png variant). The actual image file does not appear in the diff as an added file, meaning the static asset itself may not have been committed.",
