        "summary": "Fix the serial number (admission ID) generation logic in the backend so that every member receives a globally unique serial number. The current bug allows two members to share the same numeric suffix (e.g., Kunwar Akhand Pratap Singh has 2023000004 and Sonu Singh has 2024000004 — both ending in 000004). The new logic must ensure the sequential counter is shared across all members regardless of year prefix, so no two members ever get the same trailing numeric part. The counter must be stored as a single stable value in the actor state and incremented atomically on each new registration.",
