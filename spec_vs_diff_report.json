  "summary": "The diff implements fixes across backend (main.mo) and frontend (useGetCandidateByMobile.ts, ReprintIdCardPage.tsx) for all three requirements. REQ-1 and REQ-2 backend fixes are present with a normalizeMobileNumber function and candidates map usage. REQ-3 frontend hook and page updates are present with normalization logic. However, the backend file is truncated so full verification of getCandidateByMobile querying the main candidates map and the Hindi error message display in ReprintIdCardPage (also truncated) cannot be fully confirmed. Based on available evidence, all requirements appear to be addressed with no hallucinated features detected.",
