REQ-1 is addressed in backend/main.mo (sequential numeric ID returned on submission) and frontend AdmissionFormPage.tsx (displays backend-returned ID). REQ-3 is addressed in useSubmitAdmissionForm.ts (MobileAlreadyRegisteredError with existingAdmissionID) and backend/main.mo (duplicate mobile check). All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the diff evidence.",
